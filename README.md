# ASO-essential_variables

This repository provides a listing and description of Essential Variables (EVs) relevant to the Southern Ocean, with a strong emphasis on biodiversity and ecosystem-related variables. The format and structure follow the approach developed by [EuropaBON](https://github.com/EuropaBON/EBV-Descriptions/wiki), with adaptations to the Southern Ocean context.

For a general introduction to the concept of Essential Variables, see the [NASA EarthData backgrounder](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/backgrounders/essential-variables). "EVs are variables that are known to be important for detecting and monitoring a specific aspect of the Earth system. As a shared set of reliable and consistent measures, as well as standards for data collection and distribution, EVs enable data usability across numerous platforms and agencies."

Essential Variables have been developed in various domains, including:

- **Oceanography**: Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs)
- **Climatology**: Essential Climate Variables (ECVs)
- **Biodiversity**: Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs)

While each domain defines its own set of variables, many are **interlinked and complementary**, allowing for integrated monitoring across systems.

## Documentation and reports
- Detailed **descriptions of variables** are available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/biodiversity-aq/SO-essential_variables/wiki).
- Two complementary **reports** are available:
  - One focusing on [marine essential variables](https://zenodo.org/records/13730496). üåä
  - Another addressing [terrestrial essential variables](https://zenodo.org/records/15799169). üèîÔ∏è
- A growing Zotero group library with relevant literature can be found [here](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5073939/essential_variablessouthernocean).

## Contributing to the Southern Ocean, Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic Essential Variables Wiki

This repository aims to document, refine, and evolve the list of **EVs** for observing and understanding **Southern Ocean, Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic ecosystems**.

We welcome suggestions, corrections, new variable proposals, and broader feedback from all - scientists, data managers, policy experts, and community stakeholders. Click [here](https://github.com/biodiversity-aq/ASO-essential_variables/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more.
